For example, you can click on BTC for Bitcoin and ETH for Ethereum. The data of the unit you clicked will appear on a chart.\n This top chart gives you a brief summary. The information you see here consists of general summaries of a cryptocurrency. The box you see at the top of the chart contains an analysis of the market price. For any address with a balance of tokens, ITB identifies the average cost at which those tokens were purchased and compares it to current price. If Current Price > Average Cost, address is “In the Money.” If Current Price < Average Cost, address is “Out of the Money”. The second box indicates the total stocks of whales and investors. Whales are addresses that own more than 1% of the circulating supply and investors are addresses that own between 0.1% and 1% of the circulating supply.\n The third box gives the 30-day price correlation with Bitcoin as described in the title. Correlation refers to changes that occur simultaneously. If the other coin you are interested in is also increasing when Bitcoin goes up, there is a positive correlation. We can come across this situation in our daily life as well\n-----",
